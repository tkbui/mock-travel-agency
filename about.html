				In 2008, the Adventure Travel Agency's founders—Basil, Herb, and Sage—first met during a
				high school travel volunteer trip with
				<a href="https://globalglimpse.org/">Global Glimpse</a>. For two weeks, they were in the
				Dominican Republic to teach English, fix the piping at a local village, and experience local
				food, shops, and scenery. After that, the three kept traveling together through personal
				leisurely trips or more travel volunteering opportunities with
				<a href="https://www.worldpackers.com/">Worldpackers</a>. After becoming seasoned travelers,
				they wanted to share their own advice and first-hand experiences to make traveling a
				smoother, less daunting, and stress-free time for others.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this goal in mind, the three began their consulting services in 2015 locally for
				neighbors, coworkers, and family friends during their free time. After their business grew
				from satisifed customers' reviews, the three dedicated themselves full-time to the ATA so
				that they could help even more people with their traveling goals and dreams.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, Basil, Herb, and Sage have added a handful of their other experienced travelers to
				their team. Together, they have a collective expertise of many travel destinations and their
				best-kept secrets—all used to perfect the itineraries we craft for our customers!
